# handwrtiitendigits

Understand how deep learning can solve problems traditional programming methods cannot 
    Learn about the MNIST handwritten digits dataset 
    Use the Keras API to load the MNIST dataset and prepare it for training
    Create a simple neural network to perform image classification 
    Train the neural network using the prepped MNIST dataset 
    Observe the performance of the trained neural network
